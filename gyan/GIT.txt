If you want to perform some changes to the main branch in a repository (not necessarily master branch)
For our current scenario, I am considering that we want to make changes to "master" branch

following steps you perform
1. git pull master
2. git branch TEMP-MY-CHANGES
3. git commit -m "Content regarding the changes"
4. git push

Now we create a pull request to merge are changes 

master <--  TEMP-MY-CHANGES

Github will show file by file differences in 3rd tab of pull-request (https://github.com/tapankumar23/pure_awesomeness_devs/pulls)
