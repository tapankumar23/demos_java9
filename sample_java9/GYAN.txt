Golden Rule >>>>> "Export a Package but Require a Module"




Transitive Dependencies
=======================
* If A requires B
	 C requires B
	 C get A
	   
A Transfer of dependencies to dependent modules


Qualified Exports
=================
* Qualified exports reverse the dependency flaw.
* Exporting module should not know which modules are depending upon them, A Qualified export breaks this Rule.


Service Dependencies
====================
* Service loader does not replace dependency injection framework.
* Ideal for standalone java SE applications

Optional Dependencies
